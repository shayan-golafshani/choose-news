### Front-End Final Mod 3 Project by: [Shayan Golafshani](https://github.com/shayan-golafshani)

## Overview
This was the final mod3 project at the Turing School of Software and Design. I decided to make a zen-vibes poetry browser for people who want to explore poetry, while listening to lofi-music, and looking at abstract art. The audience is real niche, probably a little too niche. Here are the links of the User Personas I made when ideating the app. 
[Persona1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFoHzFE2LR2X0Xfq9lH5kFs4qrvwQ3AncRIwOZWEDAM/edit?usp=sharing)
[Persona2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PJsbCFfbB_HqptnrRsxO9fWwdqZS0YvPoiElQNzlK4/edit?usp=sharing)
You can find the spec [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html).

## Deployed
The app is deployed to heroku [here](https://tha-zen.herokuapp.com/)!

# Instructions for Viewing Locally 
  * Clone down this repo by copying the SSH key and from your terminal git clone <repo SSH key>
  * `npm i` to install dependencies
  * cd into the repo
  * `npm start` to activate the server
  * Open localhost:3000 in your browser to view the project

  
# Learning Goals 
  * Build upon the foundational skills of React, including use of React Hooks, useEffect and useState.  
  * Utilizes React Router for url navigation
  * Demonstart knowledge of error handling and conditional rendering
  * Retrieve and display poems from https://poetrydb.org and display images from https://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com/
  * Utilize PropTypes 
  * End-to-end testing of user flows using Cypress
  * Local storage use with React Hooks
  
# Walkthrough
  
- As a user, you are greeted with a landing page that shows you a poem sandwiched between some rad spinning art, and an easy to listen to lofi beat. 
  
[Main Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70605985/128796662-10e606cc-fd5f-40c4-b83d-93ffd636de22.png)

- Next there's a poem selection page, where you can look up poems written by your favorite authors and have those display in scrollable cards!

- Then there's the favorite page! You can look at a list of all the poems you've favorited thus far. These poems persist via local-storage so you don't need to worry about losing them.
