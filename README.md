### Front-End Mod 4 Take Home Challenge by: [Shayan Golafshani](https://github.com/shayan-golafshani)

## Overview
This was a take home challenge for module 4 at the Turing School of Software and Design. We were asked to make a simple react app of a new-reader.

You can find the spec [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe).

## Deployed
The app is deployed to heroku [here](https://choose-news.vercel.app/)!

# Instructions for Viewing Locally 
  * Clone down this repo by copying the SSH key and from your terminal git clone <repo SSH key>
  * `npm i` to install dependencies
  * cd into the repo
  * `npm start` to activate the server
  * Open localhost:3000 in your browser to view the project

  
# Learning Goals 
  * Build upon the foundational skills of React, including use of React Hooks, useEffect and useState.  
  * Utilizes React Router for url navigation
  * Demonstart knowledge of error handling and conditional rendering
  * Retrieve and display poems from https://poetrydb.org and display images from https://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com/
  * Utilize PropTypes 
  * End-to-end testing of user flows using Cypress
  * Local storage use with React Hooks
  
# Walkthrough
  
- As a user, you are greeted with a landing page that shows you a random top New York Times article that displays the category, title, multimedia image carousel, and which links to the actual page.  
<!-- [Main Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70605985/128796662-10e606cc-fd5f-40c4-b83d-93ffd636de22.png) -->

- Next there's an article selection page, where you can look up poems written by your favorite authors and have those display in scrollable cards!

<!-- - Then there's the favorite page! You can look at a list of all the poems you've favorited thus far. These poems persist via local-storage so you don't need to worry about losing them.
